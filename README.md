## Java Project - Snap
This project is a game of Snap and was made using Java. The aim of the project was to demonstrate my understanding of the four pillars of OOP.

## Project Goals
1. **Create a Working Game** The main task is to create a game of Snap; testing your understanding of Java and OOP (Object Orientated Programming) and how to break down a problem.
2. **Practice Using Git and GitHub Flow** This project gives the opportunity to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line through IntelliJ.
3. **Application of Learning** Apply what you have been learning on course so far with the focus on Java. This project should be broken down into a number of classes with their own role which interact with each other.

## Project Breakdown

**Card.java:**
* Represents an individual playing card with attributes like suit, symbol, and value, providing methods to retrieve and display card information.

**CardGame.java:**
* Serves as an abstract base class for various card games, managing a deck of cards, handling card dealing, shuffling, and providing a game name.

**Snap.java:**
* Extends CardGame and encapsulates the specific rules and logic for playing the "Snap" card game, including dealing cards, checking for Snap conditions, and determining the winner.

**Main.java:**
* Contains the main method, acting as the entry point, creating and initiating the "Snap" game, and orchestrating the overall flow of the card game.
